The handle vibrates idly in your hands as it tries to adjust to a perfect position, out of your grasp. The pommel has a blue light, and more lights can be seen lining the head of the axe. The majority of its momentum modules are along the head, allowing for the most powerful chopps while cutting costs on usless extra modules." />

The handle vibrates idly in your hands as it tries to adjust to a perfect position, out of your grasp. The pommel has a blue light, and more lights can be seen circling up round and around the head of the club. The vast majority of its momentum modules are in the head, allowing for the most powerful bashes, with a notable excess on momentum modules to the point that every new one helps less and less. Its fun though, to clobber something with every bit of your might, though the autopilot makes it less fun." />

The handle vibrates idly in your hands as it tries to adjust to a perfect position, out of your grasp. The pommel has a blue light, and more lights can be seen lining the blade of the shiv. The few momentum modules lie in the blade, compensating for the weak force with less to propell, making the little thing ruthlessly fast, and lacking the need of an expert to use well." />
